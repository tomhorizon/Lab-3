    accelerometers. These inexpensive phone accelerometers talk to the CPU

    * The device can be switched from standby mode to active mode and back
    * Readings from all three axes can be taken in A/D bits or in g's
    * The range can be set to +/-2g, +/-4g, or +/-8g

    be added by someone with too much time on her or his hands :P
